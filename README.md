This is my "notebook" on repairing the Tigerbox

## What is a Tigerbox

A [Tigerbox](https://tiger.media) is a music device for kids.
Music can be selected by inserting a "tigercard" (basically a special rfid contaningin an ID) into a slot on the side.
Alternatively the box can be used using the touch-display on the top.

## Components of the box
